## Creating Our List

As we learned from an earlier section, the very first thing needed for any outbound campaign are a list of people to call, email or text In todays case, we will be building a basic list of our "prospects" to include, which in this case, is you!

We begin by creating our csv file in excel. For todays workshop our list will be very basic. We are only looking to include the name of the prospect, their phone number and any extra desired fields such as prospective interestes taken from the G Freight site. SInce we are only looking to start by making this functional, we will just add a name and phone number in the steps below:

First, we will open excel and create a new workbook. Once we have created our workbook, we will be creating two data fields, the first is customer name and the second is phone number. Then, add your desired name as well as a phone number you will be able to answer once called such as a cell or work number.

> Note: Putting your friends phone number in here is funny, but remember, they will get a call!
