G Freight wants to make sure that not only are we reaching out to prospects, we want to reach out to them at the right times. Nobody, no matter how interested in a technology, wants a call at 6AM! Here, we will create a rule set to ensure that the running campaign only calls prospects in the lead list at appropriate times, or times we believe will lead to a high chance of success.

to create a contactable time set, we navigate to Admin > Outbound > Contactable Timesets and create a new time set

We will then name and create our time set, moving on to select the schedule and time zone the time set is associated with:

Once you save and move to the schedule view, you can use your cursor to drag the schedule boxes to specific callable times you'd like the campaign to adhere to

Now that we have created our Contactable timesets, we now have the basics of whats needed to create an outbound campaign.

So far we have created some of the basic and bare bones configuration elements for an outbound campaign. In future workshops, we will be diving deeper in to more specific and complex use cases to create your campaigns!
