# Welcome to our Outbound Campaign Workshop
Your business, a Package/Freight delivery firm, is reimagining the way they engage with their customers. The business, G Freight, luckily already uses Genesys Cloud CX for inbound communications with customers. In this workshop, it'll be your job to help G Freight utilize the full bread of Genesys Cloud CX's outbound suite to satisfy and exceed their requirements. They've broken their requirements out by media type. 

## Voice
G Freight uses the voice channel for sales outreaches. As a B2B company, these are typically high impact calls and they are calling business executives of prospective opportunities. They also need automated list management fed from various sources and pre and post calls rules to help automate lists as they are running.

## SMS
G Freight wants to use SMS for freight delivery updates. For example, they want their businesses to be contacted for estimated delivery time, delays and any other changes to their deliveries.

## Email
G Freight wants to utilize email campaigns for offering discounts to their customers during holiday seasons. Black Friday is upcoming, and G Freight wants to gather up more of their customers shipping needs by offering Black Friday discounts to them.
